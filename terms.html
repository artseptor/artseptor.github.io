<ul><ol>(1). <strong>DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES</strong></ol></ul>



<ul><ol>1. The reported tests are for the notification of the referring doctor which must be used only to assist him/her in the diagnosis and the management of the patient.</ol><ol>2. The test results relate only to the specimen tested.</ol><ol>3. If the collection date was not stated in the test request form, the current date will print by default as the date of collection. Collection refers to “collection of the primary sample”.</ol><ol>4. For tests performed on specimens received from location other than Company’s Center, it is presumed that the specimen belongs to the patient named or identified, such verification being carried out at the point of generation of the said specimen.</ol><ol>5. A test requested might not be performed for the following reasons:<br>(a). Specimen quantity insufficient (inadequate collection/spillage during transit)<br>(b). Specimen quality unacceptable (hamolysed/clotted/lipemic etc.)<br>(c). Incorrect specimen type<br>(d). Test cancelled either on request of patient or doctor, or due to incorrect test code, test name of test specimen received.<br>(e). It is expected that a fresh specimen will be sent for the purpose of reporting on the same parameters.<br>(f). A test requested may yield invalid results for various technical reasons, it is expected that a fresh specimen will be sent for the purpose of reporting.<br>(g). Assays are performed and reported in accordance with the stated scheduled day and time given in the listing. In the event of unforeseen circumstances (unavailability of test kits, failure of test runs, need for repeat sample/testing, Instrument breakdown and natural calamities). The Company will make all efforts to minimize the delay in reporting.<br>(h). A repeat investigation / additional investigation for clinical samples and histopathology specimens will be possible, as per our sample retention policy i.e. within 24 hours and one month from the issue of test report respectively, unless otherwise required and mentioned by the client during sample registration.<br>(i). Assays are performed in accordance with standard procedure on receipt. The reported results are dependent on individual assay methods, equipment used, method specificity, sensitivity and quality of specimen(s) received. All investigations have their limitations and isolated laboratory investigations may not confirm the final diagnosis of disease. They only help at arriving at a diagnosis in conjunction with clinical findings and relevant investigations. The reports are therefore expected to be interpreted taking into consideration these facts.<br>(j).
